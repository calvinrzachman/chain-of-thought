There is this notion that a currency must be “backed” by something - that it
cannot be valued on its own merit. I am not sure if this is true (I think it
very much depends on what society is using as money. If using a debt/fiat based
money with marginal production cost of 0 then a “backing” is likely necessary
to constrain production and lend credibility to the scarcity of the medium.),
but assume for a second that framework is correct. Consider potential backings
for a currency: Gold backed currency. Oil backed currency. Basket of commodity
backed currency. These are all attempts to back a currency with a “stock” of
static and existing material. The problem: How do you prove a stock? 

Proof of stock for physical items is NOT possible without trust. Who will hold
the the stock and where? Do they still have as much stock as they say they do?
You can attempt to conduct periodic audits, but those too require trust in the
auditor. Proving a stock is not publicly verifiable. There will always be trust
involved. You cannot trustlessly back with a physical stock.

Bitcoin backs a digital commodity with a flow. Bitcoin proves a flow. 
Proof of flow is possible in a way that is trust-less/publicly verifiable
(see: probabilistic nature of Proof of Work). The flow is energy channeled/consumed.

Interestingly, proof of stock for digital items may very well be possible. 

So we have this distinction: Backed by stock (potential energy) vs backed by
flow (kinetic energy).
