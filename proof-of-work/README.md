# Proof of Work


Require that for any message to be valid that it carry with it a valid Proof of Work. What is Proof of Work? It’s exactly what it sounds like. It is a proof that a certain amount of physical work has been done. A freshly mowed lawn or Thanksgiving table is proof that some amount of work has been performed. My message “Hey dad I mowed the lawn today” is easily verified by him looking out the window and seeing a pristine lawn. We can however construct another proof of work better suited towards building a digital money by exploiting the random nature of the cryptographic hash function mentioned previously.  

It is better suited since it lets us pass on the work to the computers. In place of human time, we use compute time. But because computers require energy to function, compute time is still tied to the physical world.

Consider a hash function with a 2 bit output space. In other words, all inputs are mapped to one of 4 values: 00, 01, 10, or 11. Notice that we have 2^2 = 4 possible outputs and that half of these begin with a zero and exactly a quarter begin with two zeroes. Expand the hash function output space to 3 bits. Now we have 2^3 = 8 outputs as follows: 000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111. Again, half of these outputs begin with zero and exactly a quarter begin with two zeroes. Imagine an N bit output space. This contains 2^N possible values, exactly half of which have a leading zero. Exactly a quarter of which have 2 leading zeroes. Exactly one eighth have 3 leading zeroes and so on. 

Our proof of work can take the form of requiring that, for a message to be valid, we produce a message whose hash output contains X number of leading zeroes. The greater X the more difficult this problem becomes. We are using a function that gives output randomly distributed across its output space and restricting the number of outputs we will accept as being valid. Naturally the further we restrict this output space the more work will be required to produce a valid message. Important also is that X is a tunable parameter which can be adjusted to set the difficulty at wherever we require. 

We can liken this scenario to throwing darts at a dart board and requiring that only a bullseye is valid. The output space of the hash function is the dart board. The smaller the size of the bullseye (the more leading zeroes) the more work will be required to produce a bullseye. This is more of a Proof of Skill perhaps, but maybe Skill == more work?? 

What can we do with the ability to prove work? We can achieve consensus on state amongst participants of a global network. That is, we can get them to agree on the state of the system however we define it.


NOTE: This form of proof of work is actually very efficient in the sense the time to verify any amount of work does not depend on the amount of work being verified. Whether verifying 10 or 10 trillion hashes, verification time remains constant, requiring only a single SHA-256 hash operation
