# chain-of-thought
A collection of ideas and writings on topics in the crypto space

This repository is intended to be a drafting space writing. Upcoming topics include:
- Proof of Work
- How Does Lightning Network Scale? (Global vs Local state/information)
  - Lightweight money substitutes/proxy (paper receipts with claim on gold vs. valid transaction which spend from multi-sig UTXO)

## Understanding Bitcoin
- hash function
- hashed messages
- chain of hashed messages (imposes an order to the messages)
- chain of hashed messages with proof of work (ties digital to physical. Brings finality/weight to system state)
- build a Network which maintains the hashed chain of messages
- Application to currency: What should the messages be? Transactions lists! (Blocks) -> Ordered list of transactions (Ordered chain of blocks)
