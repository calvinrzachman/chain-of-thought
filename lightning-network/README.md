# Lightning Network

How does the Lightning Network scale Bitcoin? 
What commonalities does the scaling approach share with traditional scaling methods?
What makes it different from scaling of old?

- Brief outline on how centralization and money substitutes helped human civilization scale
    ```
    [ Reread Social Scalability by Nick Szabo and Money Warehouses (Chapter 12 of What Has Government Done to Our Money - Rothbard ]
    ```
    As Nick Szabo says “gold’s physicality necessitated it’s centralization”, and that centralization might one day cost us   everything. Central governments used the public's faith in gold as money to bootstrap their acceptance of paper money. They made paper as good as gold.

- Explain how Lightning scales in a similar way, but with a twist. We again introduce a proxy or money substitute of sorts (signed data structures called Bitcoin transactions), but do so in such a way that we capture all of the upside of scaling with little to no downside.

- Think about it from a perspective of global vs. local consensus
